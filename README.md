### TwentyOne
A simple console game in which a player sits at a table with however much money they would like to bring and plays one-on-one against the dealer.  This project highlights using classes, enums, arrays, constructors and logic in providing a realistic sense of randomness and chance in playing blackjack.

### Basic C# Projects
The majority of projects contained within this repository are to demonstrate the basic understanding of the C# language and how to utilize it in programmming.  Each project is named for its main feature and you will see how I execute each feature with full functionality.
